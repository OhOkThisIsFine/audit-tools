/**
 * The CREDENTIAL a source authenticates with, as a stable, value-free string —
 * `(normalized endpoint, credential REFERENCE)`. Two sources reaching the same
 * endpoint through the same credential reference resolve to one identity, which is
 * what makes them ONE metered account.
 *
 * ⚠ It compares REFERENCES, not values — and a reference is the ONLY way to declare a
 * credential, so two declarations of one key cannot disagree. Keying on the VALUE is
 * refused deliberately: identity would then change whenever the operator rotates the
 * credential, orphaning ledger state for what is still the same account. The mixed
 * reference/inline config that used to split one key into two metered accounts is now
 * unrepresentable rather than detected — inline `api_key` is retired and refused at
 * validation (`validation/sessionConfig.ts`).
 *
 * ⚠ Never contains a secret: an `api_key_env` contributes its NAME. This string is
 * persisted into the reservation-ledger file and appears in artifacts. Ledger state
 * written before the retirement can still carry an `…::inline:<hash>` segment; it stays
 * readable as opaque historical state (nothing parses the segment) and expires with its
 * lease — the retirement removes the way to DECLARE one, not the ability to read one.
 *
 * Returns null only when the source exposes no discriminator at all — no endpoint,
 * or no credential.

/**
 * The ACCOUNT a pool meters against — the partition an `account`-scoped quota
 * window's allowance is shared across.
 *
 * Decided HERE, at the producer, from the source's own declaration. It is NOT
 * recoverable from the pool-key string: `dispatchableSourceId` returns an explicitly
 * declared `source.id` verbatim, so an operator naming two models `nim-nano` and
 * `nim-super` on one credential produces two keys with no account segment and no
 * shared substring. Parsing identity back out of that string was the defect that made
 * a fifth round of this repair necessary — the producer holds the credential, so the
 * producer decides.
 *
 * Precedence: an explicit operator `account` declaration always wins (two declared
 * accounts on one endpoint must never be silently re-merged), then the derived
 * credential identity. Returns null when neither is available, and the caller then
 * falls back to a pool-scoped key — correct, because a source we cannot attribute to
 * a credential must not be merged with anyone else's allowance.
 *
 * ⚠ The namespace is the SERVICE, never the transport — on BOTH branches. Account is only
 * meaningful WITHIN a service (`spec/backend-identity-axes.md`), so the partition is
 * `(service, account|credential)`. Two consequences the transport-keyed version got wrong:
 *
 *  - EXPLICIT account: a proxied lane (`transport: claude-worker`, `service: nim`) and a
 *    direct lane (`transport: openai-compatible`, `service: nim`) both declaring
 *    `account: "work"` are ONE credential at one vendor and must yield ONE partition
 *    (`nim#work`) — keying on transport split them and double-booked the budget.
 *  - DERIVED credential: every proxied `claude-worker` lane shares the PROXY's `endpoint`
 *    and `api_key_env` (see `expandSources`), differing only in `service`. A service-less
 *    credential identity therefore collapses every backend behind one proxy into one key —
 *    so a 429 on the free `nim` lane would gate a paid `anthropic` lane. Namespacing the
 *    credential by service (`nim#<endpoint>::env:<var>` vs `anthropic#…`) keeps same-service
 *    siblings merged while holding distinct services apart. This is why the cooldown fold
 *    can key on `CapacityPool.accountKey` directly and no longer needs a transport guard.
 *
 * Service is normalized to `declared ?? transport` at the producer
 * (`collectDispatchableSources`), so the `?? transport` fallback only fires for an
 * un-normalized source.
