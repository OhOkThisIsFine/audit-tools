/**
 * A-8 hybrid dispatch split — audit driver (FINDING-020 capstone).
 *
 * The audit-side counterpart of remediate's hybrid split. The conversation host
 * reviews packets in a BATCH (the `semantic_review` / worker-run handoff), while the
 * in-process provider engine (`driveRollingAuditDispatch`) reviews packets itself.
 * Under the hybrid topology both run for ONE review obligation: the in-process driver
 * reviews the coordinator-assigned backend (NIM) partition this cycle, and — because
 * `mergeAndIngest` folds `task-results/` by `task_id` and `buildPendingAuditTasks` is
 * COVERAGE-driven — the host-review path then automatically covers only the complement
 * (the NIM tasks already have results, so they are no longer pending).
 *
 * So the audit split is simpler than remediate's: pass ONLY the NIM pool(s) to the
 * shared {@link HybridSpillCoordinator}. It bounds NIM to its capacity and CLAIMS each
 * assigned task BEFORE returning it (exactly-one-claimant — a second in-process loop
 * can never grab the same task); everything it does not assign is left pending for the
 * batch host review. The coordinator is the SAME shared assignment layer remediate
 * drives, so the spill topology cannot drift between the two tools.
