# Backlog — open work, durable traps & future directions

A living **to-do list**, not a status log. Remove an entry once it ships — record durable
contracts/rationale in project memory or `CLAUDE.md`, never "where the code is today."

## Live-validation guide — READ FIRST if you're running a live audit/remediate

Most open items below are **code-complete and only await a real run to confirm**. Each such item
carries a **⬇ Live-run watch** line: exactly what to observe during the run to confirm it validated —
or to catch it failing. Pick a run config from this matrix; watch the items it lights up.

| Run config | Items it exercises (watch their ⬇ lines) |
|---|---|
| **Any** live audit, any provider | Selective-deepening convergence · knip `files`/`dependencies` dead-code leads |
| **Metered provider + LARGE target** — this is what exercises the wall (`AUDIT_TOOLS_LIVE_QUOTA=1` only enables the live-credential test probe in `tests/audit/inv2.test.mjs`, it does not force a production wall) | Quota-aware dispatch · M-QUOTA friction escalation · pre-wall pacing · retryable resume |
| **Codex backend** (`--provider codex`; Codex CLI is a nested-agent host) | Y-dispatcher driver selection · cross-provider quota (Codex live endpoint) |
| **openai-compatible / NIM backend** (`RUN_NIM_E2E=1` for the gated e2e) | openai-compatible dispatch pool · CE-004 emit-time-constraint build opportunity |
| **Rust or Ruby target repo** | clippy (cargo) + rubocop (bundle) live spawn |

**General fail-signals to log on ANY live run** (add a line under *Open bugs* if you hit one): a run
that wedges and needs `force-synthesis` to finish · orphaned pending `deepening:*` tasks · a *crash*
(not a graceful pause) when a rate limit is hit · an analyzer that silently skipped when it should have
spawned · knip dead-code leads that never reach the per-file lens. After a run, its findings are the
corpus to hand-label for the A2 oracle (see Deferred / waiting).

## Open bugs / frictions — fix in tooling (never "host remembers")

- **Charter-layer defects found + FIXED dogfooding /audit-code (2026-07-10, orchestrator + Opus recon/impl/adversarial agents).**
  A dogfood audit of this repo surfaced three defects in the conceptual design-review charter layer; all fixed
  (4 commits on the lap branch, one loop-core-attested + independently adversarially reviewed, validated
  end-to-end). Durable design → memory [[charter-layer-independence-and-node-selection]].
  - **(tool-should-decide) Consensus metric was size-hostile → charter review only ever saw test-file dyads.**
    `src/shared/decompose/consensus.ts` scored a cluster by the mean over all C(n,2) member-pairs (missing ⇒ 0),
    so only 2-file dyads cleared the bar and a 449-file `.gitignore` blob leaked into contested. Replaced with a
    size-robust per-source best-fit F1 (precision×recall) + whole-area-community cap + abstain-vs-disagree voting
    + ≥2-sources-together floor. On this repo consensus went 4 test dyads → 2 real subsystems, blob gone.
  - **(ambiguous-direction) Single agent authored all charter kinds AND their deltas — author marking own homework.**
    The design-of-record mandates independently-sourced, never-reconciled views, but one host pass wrote
    stated/inferred/revealed + the deltas. Split into a charters-only extraction (independent, access-scoped
    per-kind subagents: revealed=code-only, stated=docs-only) + a NEW `charter_delta` step where an independent
    miner authors the gaps + goal_graph. The delta is now genuine disagreement, not one narrator's story.
  - **(tool-should-decide) Prompt advertised "four charters" at a `deep` ceiling that only requests three.**
    The count string was hardcoded; now tracks the ceiling (True nominatable only at `deepest`).
  - **Recurrence of [[external-audit-catalogs-are-leads]] / verify-before-building:** the charter step was
    reviewing test files because the *consensus criterion itself* was the bug — not visible without dogfooding.
    A live self-audit remains the cheapest way to surface these; the env-bound dispatch/quota watch items below
    were the original goal of the run and are still unexercised (audit paused at charter phase to fix the tool).

- **A doc-review auto-apply / hook re-reverted a COMMITTED owner decision during a process restart (2026-07-10, tool-should-decide).**
  Mid-lap the process restarted; on restart, CLAUDE.md + `project-philosophy.md` came back MODIFIED — the change
  reverted the DD-1 Own-vs-acquire→CLAUDE.md promotion the owner had explicitly chosen and I had already committed
  (`f886066e`). `git reflog` showed NO git op caused it (only my own commits) → it was a DIRECT file edit by a hook /
  the doc-review nightly re-applying its stale PRE-decision proposal. Caught by noticing the unexpected `M` in
  `git status` before committing; restored the committed (owner-decided) version. **Trap:** after a process
  restart, `git diff` your instruction files before committing — a background doc-review/hook can silently
  re-assert a pre-decision version, and the reflog won't show it. **Tool fix (open):** the doc-review auto-apply
  must not re-propose/re-apply an item whose decision is already recorded resolved (or already committed to the
  tracked tree) — it should reconcile against HEAD, not a stale branch snapshot. Relates
  [[enforce-robustness-in-tooling-not-host-discretion]].
- **Friction-walk (quota-Increment-A lap, 2026-07-10):** the carried-in diagnosis OVERSTATED the gap ("host path has
  no enforcing loop") — recon + adversarial review refined it to "the admission DECISION is already shared and runs on
  the host path; only two EDGES are missing, and the cold-start over-grant is the real correctness bug." Recurrence of
  verify-before-building [[spec-degradation-and-doc-staleness]] (no new tool work — pointer only). Feeding clean
  (subagent recon returned conclusions+file:line; doc cleanup delegated). One waste: the post-impl reviewer died on a
  process restart (state lost) → re-ran one review cycle.

- **Friction-walk (lease-TTL lap, 2026-07-10):** (tool-should-decide) the SessionStart doc-review hook
  reported "19 open items" from the worktree's PRE-SYNC state — all 19 were already applied+resolved on
  main; the hook should reconcile against the fetched remote resolved-state (or flag "worktree behind main —
  list may be stale") before surfacing. (ambiguous-direction) HANDOFF's ▶ IMMEDIATE NEXT pointed at a
  live-run-GATED item (D-66/67 slice-3), so the actual next actionable had to be inferred from track prose —
  fixed this lap by keeping gated items out of the ▶ slot. Feeding was clean (recon + adversarial review as
  subagents returning file:line conclusions). Also: the dormant half-built `leaseTtlMs` seam carried a doc
  comment describing behavior nothing exercised — a seam built "for later" without a consumer is a latent
  false-documentation trap (this lap wired it).

- **M-B3 citation gate re-emits the WRONG phase — gate input is `module_decomposition`, repair target is
  `contract_finalization` (2026-07-09).** `evaluatePreCriticCitationGrounding` (src/remediate/steps/contractPipeline.ts
  ~1209) grounds `module_decomposition.file_scope` against the working tree, but on failure the router re-emits
  `contract_finalization` with a "module contract cites…" prompt — re-authoring finalized contracts can never change
  the decomposition's file_scope, so an ungrounded scope loops forever (hit live on the ARC-0c1762db run: file_scope
  cited untracked scratch `all_batch1_prompts.json`; unblocked by hand-editing `module_decomposition.input.json`,
  which ingest re-derives). Fix: route the M-B3 re-emit to a `module_decomposition` repair step (and word the gate
  error as a decomposition file_scope defect), or ground file_scope at decomposition-ingest so the defect surfaces in
  the producing phase, not three phases later.
- **Untracked-exclusion scope rule — residuals (shipped 2026-07-10; each low-severity, documented at the
  code site).** The scratch-pollution bug is FIXED in tooling: `buildFileDisposition` now runs an `untracked`
  scope rule (one batched `git ls-files -z`; still-included files absent from the index → `excluded/untracked`,
  guards mirror the gitignore rule) so untracked litter can never enter the auditable scope, plus a
  single-sourced `renderHostScratchNote`/`hostScratchDir` prompt line directing host scratch into
  `.audit-tools/<area>/scratch/<run-id>/`. The unsound bounded/aggregate exclusion representation was deleted
  outright (a missing disposition record reads as *included* downstream, so aggregation silently un-excluded
  exactly the matched files — per-file records are now mandatory, validator-enforced). Residuals:
  - (a) **Submodule / nested-repo contents are now excluded as `untracked`** (parent `ls-files` lists only the
    gitlink). Consistent with citation grounding (which also can't ground them), but a silent scope change for
    repos with first-party submodules. Ideal fix = `--recurse-submodules` in BOTH the disposition rule and the
    grounding corpora (`findingGrounding.enumerateTrackedFilePaths`, M-B3 `enumerateRepoTreePaths`) as one
    atomic change — never one side alone (re-opens the asymmetry).
  - (b) **`file_disposition` now depends on git index state, which the dependency DAG doesn't track**
    (`dependencyMap.ts` keys it to `repo_manifest.json` only). An index-only change (committing a
    previously-untracked file) won't re-stale a persisted disposition until repo_manifest churns.
    ⬇ Live-run watch: after committing files mid-run-continuity, confirm they enter scope on the next audit.
  - (c) **Scope-rule guard decisions are invisible at the intent checkpoint** — `computeScopePreDigest` reads
    only per-file entries; a skipped rule (`root_untracked`/`share_exceeded`/git-absent fallback) never
    surfaces to the operator despite the summary existing for exactly that purpose.
  - (d) **Grounding corpora still use `ls-files` without `-z`** (`findingGrounding.ts:108`,
    `contractPipelineGates.ts` ~1034): non-ASCII tracked paths arrive C-quoted (`core.quotePath`), so citations
    to such paths fail grounding while the disposition (which uses `-z`) keeps them in scope.
  - (e) The audit `renderEdgeReasoningStepPrompt` single-agent dispatch carries no scratch-dir note (params
    lack run context; one bounded agent writing one results file — lowest-risk path, add if it ever litters).
- **`validate-artifact --name judge_report` can never return "ok" for an honest needs_repair verdict (2026-07-09).**
  The self-check runs the cross-gate `implementation_dag.evidence_threading` (OBL-CO-03 check 2,
  src/remediate/validation/contractPipelineGates.ts:600), fail-closed when accepted counterexamples exist and no
  implementation_dag does — but the DAG only exists after judge approval, so the needs_repair path is unsatisfiable at
  judge-authoring time. Ingest applies only the structural validator so the run proceeds, but the self-check
  contradicts the step prompt's "fix issues until ok". Fix: scope judge_report validate-artifact to the structural
  validator (or suppress DAG-dependent cross-gates for artifacts authored before the DAG phase).
- **Friction-walk lesson (ledger-writer / acceptNode-inert-clean lap):** `[[spec-degradation-and-doc-staleness]]`
  (verify premises before building; a pause/interrupt is not a content-veto) — see memory. Open tool slivers:
  (a) NIM `llm read` going down silently degrades the "route review to free NIM" plan to paid subagents with no
  signal — a health-probe-then-route would remove the guesswork; (b) ad-hoc Agent fan-out (recon/review/
  compaction) still has no per-agent ledger for a session-limit mid-edit death, unlike remediate-code's per-node
  worktrees + claims.

- **External shared-logic audit V1–V7 residuals** (each deliberate, low-severity, documented at the code
  site):
  - **(from V3) postinstall agent-scope legacy-wildcard migration gap.** Both postinstall scripts preserve
    an EXISTING legacy agent-scope bash `'*':'allow'` in an already-deployed
    `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` on upgrade (the wrapper/install path DOES migrate it → `'ask'`;
    pinned deliberate by remediate's COR-fc1f12a6 tests). Full closure: mirror the wrapper's
    `withoutManagedBroadBashWildcard` migration into `scripts/{audit,remediate}/postinstall.mjs`.
  - **(from V5) path-guard blind spots.** `tests/shared/audit-tools-path-guard.test.mjs` cannot see
    template-literal construction (no live occurrence today) and its allowlist honesty check is
    substring-only. Tighten if a violation ever sneaks past. Also low: `validateArtifacts`'s unused
    `root="."` default now yields an absolute (not relative) report path — no live call site hits it.
  - **(from V2) conversation-first mid-run dirt is indistinguishable.** A declared-but-unedited file the
    USER dirties during the run window can still be staged in the `merge-implement-results` flow —
    `run_start_dirty` fences only pre-run dirt; full closure needs per-edit git ground truth that flow
    lacks. Documented at `collectStagingFiles`. ⬇ Live-run watch (conversation-first run on a dirty repo):
    `leftover_files` in the report must list untouched dirt; nothing outside the run's surface committed.

- **Friction-walk lesson (D-66/67 slice-1 ownership-gate lap):** design-level adversarial review pays for
  itself before a line is written, and review depth should scale with delicacy
  (`[[delegate-adversarial-phases-to-separate-agent]]`) — see memory. Open tool sliver (low value): the
  PreToolUse commit-gate fires on the whole Bash call before a chained `attest && git commit` runs, so the
  attestation half hasn't executed when the gate checks (workaround = attest as its own call); a gate that
  recognized the attest step in the same chain would remove the trap.

- **Friction-walk lesson (shared-logic-audit validation lap):** an external audit catalog is leads, not
  verdicts — validate its rows against current code + design-of-record before remediation intake
  (`[[external-audit-catalogs-are-leads]]` / `[[spec-degradation-and-doc-staleness]]`) — see memory. Open
  tool gap: remediate's grounding phase catches phantom PATHS but not stale CLAIMS ("X is duplicated" when X
  was single-sourced) — no tool support for claim-staleness (inherently judgment; handled by subagent
  verification today).

- **Friction-walk lesson (backlog-clearance lap):** a backlog item / chosen option / design memory is a
  point-in-time proposal — verify its premises against current code AND a real measurement before building
  (`[[spec-degradation-and-doc-staleness]]`) — see memory. Open tool sliver: the pre-commit gate that
  silently failed-open in linked worktrees is FIXED (scratch index → `os.tmpdir()`), but the durable
  improvement — make a fail-open on infra fault OBSERVABLE (a one-line stderr when the staged-snapshot path
  bails) rather than silent — is not yet done.

- **Top gate optimization lead (measured 2026-07-06, was the "vitest collect" item).** First profiled
  numbers (win32, Node 26 local; CI Linux will differ but the shape holds):
  - **`verify:checks` gate = 95.8s, of which `smoke:packaged-audit-code` alone is 70.2s (73%).**
    `smoke:packaged-remediate-code` is 13.2s; everything else is ~12s combined. **→ The highest-leverage gate
    win is the packaged-audit-code smoke.** Internal breakdown (measured): `next-step ×~7 to dispatch_review`
    = 35.9s (53% — the real audit-flow round-trips, inherent coverage), `npm install from tarball` 9.3s,
    `next-step to present_report` 10.1s, `npm pack` 7.2s (incl. a prepack rebuild). The next-step round-trips
    are fresh-process pipeline runs — cutting them cuts coverage, so this needs a real design (e.g. an
    in-process multi-step driver for the smoke, or packing once and sharing the tarball across both smokes
    since they build the identical `audit-tools` package), not a quick trim.
  - **Full vitest suite = 307s wall (452 files), `collect≈211s`** (confirms the old ~186s estimate), run
    time dominated by audit integration tests that spawn real subprocesses: `audit-code-completion` 285s,
    `audit-code-wrapper` 237s, `next-step` 165s, `cli-remediation` 111s. area:audit ≈ 1905s summed across
    workers vs remediate 451s / shared 62s. `pool: 'threads'` / `isolate: false` won't help the run-time
    tail (it's subprocess wall, not isolation overhead); the real lever is the sharding already shipped +
    possibly splitting the few 100s+ integration files across more shards. Only pursue collect/pool changes
    with per-file verification (many tests mutate fs / spawn subprocesses → isolation-off risks bleed).

- **Dispatch admission-control rework — residual (env-bound / deeper, not blocking).** Shipped; see
  `docs/HANDOFF.md` T5-3 for what landed. Design of record
  [`spec/audit/dispatch-admission-control.md`](spec/audit/dispatch-admission-control.md);
  [[capability-is-per-auditor-not-per-audit]] / [[dispatch-admission-control-design]].
  - (a) **live validation** of the real host+codex+NIM concurrent run — a metered multi-pool run confirming
    the demoted backend actually fans out alongside the host (folds into the quota-aware-dispatch live-run
    watch below). (b) **Deeper simultaneity:** the audit hybrid path drives the in-process (codex/NIM)
    partition to completion within a `next-step` turn, THEN hands the complement to the host — so host and
    backend alternate ACROSS turns, not simultaneously WITHIN one. True within-turn simultaneity would need
    a detached background driver spanning host turns (architectural; only pursue if wall-clock on a real
    run shows the alternation is the bottleneck).

- **Quota-aware dispatch — live validation env-bound.** Still open: live validation of the token-budget
  dispatch gate (per-`(pool,window-label)` learned tokens-per-percent slope, budget = MIN across a
  pool's windows, quota-death = retryable pause preserving worktrees) on a real rate-limited
  multi-worker run — cold-start calibration slope + the resume path especially want a live check.
  Relates to [[claude-usage-endpoint-body-shape]] / [[claude-quota-credential-resolution]] /
  [[cross-provider-quota-matrix]] / [[quota-dispatch-vision]].
  - **⬇ Live-run watch** (a metered provider + large target is the exerciser — the run itself hits the
    wall; `AUDIT_TOOLS_LIVE_QUOTA=1` only enables the live-credential test probe, it does not force a
    production wall): at the
    rate wall the run must **pause gracefully, not crash**, and leave every in-flight worktree intact; on
    resume it continues from the pause with no lost/redone work. Early on, the tokens-per-percent slope
    should *learn* (dispatch pacing adjusts after the first window reading) rather than stay at the
    cold-start default. FAIL = crash/stall at the wall, discarded worktrees, or a resume that re-does or
    drops packets.

- **Rolling-engine ledger-blocked retry spins at 50ms during a crash-orphan lease wedge (2026-07-10,
  efficiency follow-up from the lease-TTL fix; adversarial-review finding).** With `DISPATCH_LEASE_TTL_MS`
  (20 min, `src/shared/quota/reservationLedger.ts`), a crashed sibling's orphan lease can block an
  in-process run's packet for up to the TTL — correct (waits, never double-grants), but the run loop's
  pending retry tick (`rollingDispatch.ts` ~1109-1122, 50ms) then hammers `admitAgainstLedger` →
  `withFileLock` read-modify-write per pending packet (~24k lock cycles worst case). Fix direction:
  backoff on ledger-blocked retries, or heartbeat-renewed short leases (the ClaimRegistry pattern,
  `auditStep.ts:96`) restoring ~30s crash recovery. Efficiency-only; folds naturally into D-66/67 slice-3
  (heartbeat-on-long-claims) if that opens.

- **Critical-flow LLM fallback is spec'd but not wired (doc-review DD-14 #3).** `spec/audit/audit-goals.md`
  says "LLM fallback is allowed only when [the deterministic confidence] check fails." The deterministic
  side is real (`criticalFlows.fallback_required` in `src/audit/extractors/flows.ts`), but its only consumer
  (`structureExecutors.ts:173`) merely appends an informational sentence to a progress string — no executor,
  dispatch, or worker prompt triggers an actual LLM critical-flow-finding pass on the flag. Either build the
  wiring (an LLM critical-flow pass gated on `fallback_required`) or, if judged not worth it, downgrade the
  norm to a spec-only target. The norm is a valid design intent; the gap is the unbuilt consumer.

- **Friction detection — M-QUOTA escalation chain: live validation env-bound.** The
  `recordLimit → escalate → strand → quota_escalation friction` chain is unit-tested end-to-end on both
  drivers (`tests/shared/rollingDispatch.test.mjs`; `tests/audit/rolling-audit-dispatch.test.mjs` §5).
  **Still open:** live validation on a real rate-limited run. [[meta-audit-friction-must-be-tool-enforced]]
  - **⬇ Live-run watch** (same wall run as quota-aware dispatch): when a packet escalates across pools at
    the wall, a **`quota_escalation` friction event** must be captured at the step boundary — check the
    run's friction log / meta-audit surface after the run and confirm the event is present with the
    escalated packet id. FAIL = wall hit but no friction event recorded (the chain didn't fire live).

- **Selective-deepening convergence — live validation env-bound.** Both known convergence loops
  (packet-result `task_id` mismatch; idempotency_key collision across rounds) have shipped fixes and need
  a real deepening-capable run to confirm. Recovery until validated: quarantine orphan pending
  `deepening:*` tasks.
  - **⬇ Live-run watch** (any audit whose findings trigger deepening — i.e. low-confidence/high-risk areas
    that spawn `deepening:*` tasks): every `deepening:*` task must **converge and complete** within a bounded
    number of rounds; the run reaches synthesis on its own. FAIL = orphaned pending `deepening:*` tasks, the
    same finding re-deepened every round (idempotency collision), or the run only finishing via
    `force-synthesis`. If you hit it, quarantine the orphan `deepening:*` tasks and note the round count here.

- **`llm read` very large review-framed payloads still fail post-fix.** A ~700-line review-framed diff
  still fails after the upstream JSON-contract fix (clean error, no result) — workaround: split the
  payload; if it recurs, add a chunked-review mode in llm-worker-tools rather than host-side splitting.

## Forward tracks

- **Shared-logic dedup bundle — one marginal item still open.**
  - **Second-pass (2026-07-10) — 6 shipped.** A scout re-scan surfaced 7 leads; validated as
    leads-not-verdicts ([[external-audit-catalogs-are-leads]]). SHIPPED (this branch): shared
    `applyGuidanceFile` (`src/shared/intake/`); `normalizeForMatch`→`normalizeToContentTokens` rename;
    shared `reconcileAdmissionLeasesFromQuotaFile` + `finalizeProviderLaunchResult` (`src/shared/dispatch/`,
    also deleted the dead `RollingDispatchResult.observedUsage` relay); shared intent path-scope authority
    `src/shared/intent/pathScope.ts` (`pathMatchesPrefix`/`globMatches`/`fileExclusionReason`) with the
    audit/remediate structured-scope field coverage SYMMETRIZED (owner ruling: both honor
    excluded_scope + disposition_overrides + must_not_touch; per-domain unit-vs-finding aggregation stays
    forked); **shared cross-lens dedup core** `src/shared/findings/dedupe.ts`
    (`crossLensDedupe(findings, policy) → {kept, mergeMap}` + shared `absorbFinding`/`mergeGrounding`/
    `mergeAffectedFiles`) — audit `reporting/mergeFindings.ts` + remediate `dedup/crossLensDedup.ts` are now
    thin policy-selecting adapters (categoryGate soft|hard · mutate|clone · exact-identity · grounding · sort
    · break · onMerge). This is the direct payoff of the owner's one-core clarification — the "divergence" was
    all POLICY on one identical skeleton, NOT a domain fork. Finished the picture by relocating audit's
    same-lens pass + identity-key upsert (`sameLensDedupe`/`upsertFindingByIdentity`/`findingReEmissionKey`)
    into `src/shared/findings/` too, and collapsing a duplicate `findingKey` in `systemicChallengeLoop.ts`.
  - **Deliberately NOT built — Tier C (3), intra-remediate retry-cap helper** (5 `attempts >= CAP →
    escalate` sites sharing a shape): marginal — the sites are 2-3 lines each over different state records;
    a generic helper would abstract more than it saves. Revisit only if a 6th cap site appears.
  - **Not-actionable but philosophy-consistent (core already shared; remainder is a legit per-mode DRAW,
    not a fork):** projection-map capture/diff — the core (stable-serialize + leaf-diff + render) is already
    single-sourced in `src/shared/reReview/projectionDiff.ts`; the residual `compute*Delta` traversals are
    each mode's draw of its OWN artifacts (audit sync-from-bundle 7 fixed artifacts vs remediate
    async-from-disk per-artifact dependency map) — genuinely different INPUT, not duplicated logic.
  - **Rejected catalog rows (do NOT feed to remediation):** rolling-lifecycle unification as framed
    (D-66/67 owns the correct bounded slices; full unification adjudicated WRONG), hybrid-spill sharing
    (shipped — both sides call the same `HybridSpillCoordinator`/`planHybridDispatch`), generic
    `DispatchPlanner` (admission math already shared; remainders are divergent read-only-vs-git-mutating
    domains), `FindingAdmissibilityPolicy` (category error: evidence-integrity gate vs auto-apply safety
    tier — the admissibility QUESTION differs, distinct from the dedup ALGORITHM above), `FreshnessGraph`
    merge (artifact-DAG vs flat-hash are different abstractions — the real dup is the file-integrity pair in
    Tier B), cross-orchestrator `ConvergenceController` (caps are not one mechanism),
    grounding/step-contract/manifesting rows (already unified or remediate-only).

- **Free/cheap multi-account "quota-arbitrage" dispatch tier (9router-inspired) — exploration → build.**
  Fan dispatch across genuinely-free backends + (later) N captured subscription-OAuth accounts, rotating on
  429/cooldown to exceed any single subscription's limit. Key finding: this is **extra SOURCE POOLS on our
  existing machinery, not a new provider engine** — pool identity is already `(provider, account[, model])`,
  the admission loop (`admitBatch` cost-first + spill) already IS the rotation engine, the `ReservationLedger`
  already does per-key backoff, and Claude/Codex/Copilot arbitrage accounts get live per-account quota for free
  via `BaseHttpQuotaSource`. Worker shape ≈ `OpenAiCompatibleProvider` (thin `buildHeaders`/`buildUrl` subclass)
  except Kiro (AWS EventStream) + Cursor (protobuf). **Reuse (vendor+sync, MIT):** 9router's provider OAuth
  catalogue (`PROVIDER_OAUTH` + token-refresh endpoints/client_ids) — the someone-else-maintained table the
  corrected sourcing rule prefers; `ERROR_RULES` text classes. **Novel build:** a multi-account credential store
  + refresh-under-lock (encrypted, rotation-loss-safe) generalizing `ClaudeOAuthQuotaSource`. **Risks:**
  ToS/paid-account-ban (impersonating official CLIs — Claude/Codex/Cursor highest; opt-in, never default-on);
  token-security surface (multi-account refresh tokens; encrypted/never-logged/atomic — recall the Antigravity
  leak). **Phase 0 first slice (recommended, ~zero ban/security risk):** `opencode-free` (`Bearer public`) +
  `vertex-trial` (operator's own GCP $300 SA) as free source pools reusing `OpenAiCompatibleProvider` → priced
  ~0 by `deriveCostRank`, routed first, spill already handled. Then Phase 1 multi-account OAuth store
  (Claude/Codex/Copilot). Design of record + full phased plan in memory [[arbitrage-dispatch-tier-design]];
  a coverage diff (2026-07-07) confirmed 9router's price table adds nothing over models.dev, so skip it.
  Relates [[quota-dispatch-vision]] / [[dispatch-admission-control-design]] / [[cross-provider-quota-matrix]] /
  [[openai-compatible-provider]] / [[model-provider-ide-agnostic]].
  - **Phase-0 opencode-free — CODE-COMPLETE (A2 = declared seed + reactive verification, shipped 2026-07-08).**
    opencode-free is live-verified: base `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`, public `/models`, free models via
    `Bearer public` returning `cost:"0"` (design premise held; docs' "API key" is the PAID tier). opencode-free
    is a pure-config `sources[]` entry (`api_key:"public"` + `cost_per_mtok:0`) — no provider code.
    - **Increment 1 — declared per-source cost seam → SHIPPED, commit `6349bdc5`.**
      `DispatchableSource.cost_per_mtok` → `deriveCostRank` rung 2a (declared 0 = free-first). The design memory's
      "deriveCostRank prices free ~0 automatically" was FALSE (non-models.dev ids → worst band); this is the real fix.
    - **Increment 2 — reactive cost verification → SHIPPED, commit `65ace2c1` (loop-core, full pipeline).**
      Provider extracts the endpoint-reported cost (opencode's `cost`) → `LaunchFreshSessionResult.observedCostUsd`;
      dispatcher closures relay it to `RollingDispatchResult`; the rolling engine's `handleResult` demotes a
      declared-free pool that reports cost>0 (folded into `selectProvider`'s degraded partition, once per pool) +
      fires a `declared_cost_drift` friction event. `driveRolling` shares ONE demotion set across sub-waves/levels so
      the demotion + single friction emit span the whole drive (adversarial-review catch — a per-dispatcher set
      leaked free-first back at each level boundary). Ships `examples/session-config/opencode-free.json` + README.
      Adversarially reviewed (1 MEDIUM found + fixed) + green (6063 tests). A2 (1+2) complete → arbitrage-tier
      release unblocked.
    - **vertex-trial → deferred** (needs operator's GCP $300-trial SA JSON).
    - **Remaining Phase-0 = env-bound live validations only** (no more code): a real opencode-free run confirming
      declared-free routing + a live lapsed-free demotion + the `declared_cost_drift` friction event end-to-end.
- **Cost↔speed dispatch dial + free-pool maximization.** Generalizes the cost-first router — the
  minimum-cost corner of a cost-vs-throughput Pareto frontier — into a tunable operating point ON TOP of
  the kept router (does not replace it). Shipped: 1D dial (λ ∈ [0,1], capability a hard floor),
  pool-class-aware throughput derivation (`deriveThroughputConcurrency`), and the shared
  `admissionPoolsFromSummaries` builder. Design of record
  [`spec/dispatch-cost-speed-dial.md`](../spec/dispatch-cost-speed-dial.md); extends
  [[cost-first-routing-design]].
  - **Free-pool maximization (dial-independent).** Price-0 pools are first-fill at every operating point → free
    is saturated before any paid pool automatically (`costRank` already delivers it once a source is registered).
    "Maxed" = saturated to the pool's declared sustainable ceiling (`declaredCap` + rate limits + reactive 429
    floor), NOT flooded. **Correction:** the old note said this "depends on C3-AIMD" — C3-AIMD is CLOSED; the
    ceiling is now `declaredCap` + reactive backoff, no learned ceiling. Real work = **register every free source
    as a pool** = the arbitrage-tier track [[arbitrage-dispatch-tier-design]] (Phase 0 zero-ban-risk first).
  - **OPEN (owner call):** whether QUALITY also becomes tradeable vs cost (a true 2D dial, needs a per-task
    quality-worth weighting) — default recorded = 1D cost↔speed + capability floor.

- **models.dev static window can over-state a specific deployment (carried from W1).** The snapshot lists e.g.
  `claude-opus-4-7` at 1M context; a real headless run serving a 200k variant with discovery absent would over-size
  work blocks off the static rung. Mitigated by `BLOCK_SAFETY_MARGIN` 0.7 + discovered-capability always overriding —
  watch on a real headless metered run.
- **Minor provider/dispatch cleanups (low-pri, bundle opportunistically).**
  ~~providerFactory Rule 6 (`hasClaudeCodeConfig && claudeAvailable`) is a provable strict subset of Rule 9
  (`claudeAvailable`) — delete the redundant rung~~ — **FALSIFIED 2026-07-05 (verify-before-implementing).**
  Not a no-op: the opencode/codex *config-gated* rungs sit BETWEEN Rule 6 (claude config-gated) and Rule 9
  (claude bare-availability tie-break) and resolve to *different* providers. For a dual-configured operator
  (`hasClaudeCodeConfig && claudeAvailable && hasOpenCodeConfig && opencodeAvailable`), Rule 6 makes explicit
  claude config win; deleting it lets the opencode config-gated rung fire first → resolution flips
  claude-code→opencode. Rule 6 is a predicate-subset of Rule 9 but NOT redundant in the ordered table. Leave it.
  Remaining (still valid): inline `makeProviderKeyedFactory` (19 LOC, 2 sites — but it's a cross-area generic
  with its own dedicated test `tests/shared/provider-keyed-factory.test.mjs`; inlining loses cohesion,
  marginal — low value).
  Do NOT delete working proactive quota sources (`BaseHttpQuotaSource` + one-array register is already clean);
  `copilot` is correctly broker-only.

- **Schema-enforced generation — CE-004 residual (provider-blocked only).** The openai-compatible / NIM
  guided-decoding path is **SHIPPED** — the AuditResult `outputSchema` is plumbed through and the dispatch site
  sets it, so those endpoints get emit-time constraint (`guided_json` / `response_format: json_schema`). The
  sole residual is the always-on conversation host (`claude-code`), which advertises no API-level constraint
  mechanism → on that path CE-004 reduces to the repair floor (no emit-time prevention). Genuinely
  host-blocked, not a defect; unblocks only if that host gains a constraint endpoint.
  - **⬇ Live-run watch** on an openai-compatible run: results conform on first emit (repair rounds for
    schema-shape errors drop to ~0).

- **Tool-enforced dispatch broker with capability-tiered driver.** Desired end-state: (1) a gated
  primitive set as the single dispatch chokepoint (read quota, estimate tokens locally, dispatch/await);
  (2) a capability-tiered driver — Y-dispatcher (thin agent, no judgment) where the host supports nesting,
  slot-pull where it can't; (3) classify agent hosts off the cold-start floor. The single-source
  classifier, broker primitive, `HostSessionQuotaSource`, and driver selection/prompt rendering are
  **shipped**. **Open (env-bound):** live Y-dispatcher validation (needs a nested-agent host + live run)
  + proactive pre-wall quota-aware pacing.
  - **⬇ Live-run watch** (Codex backend, which nests agents): the driver-selection step must pick the
    **Y-dispatcher** path (thin dispatcher agent, no judgment) rather than slot-pull — confirm from the
    run's driver-selection log. Separately, on a metered run, pacing should slow *before* the wall (proactive)
    rather than only reacting after a 429. FAIL = slot-pull chosen on a nesting-capable host, or pacing that
    only ever reacts post-wall.

- **Deterministic analyzers: own-vs-acquire engine.** **Open:** clippy/rubocop landed fixture-only (no
  Rust/Ruby repo → live spawn unvalidated). *(Mutation testing was
  considered and dropped 2026-07-03: it doesn't fit the acquire+scan model — Stryker must run the full
  test suite per mutant and needs a per-repo test-runner config we don't own, so it either no-ops or is
  its own subsystem. Not an analyzer-registry add. Re-file as a scoped forward track only if a lightweight
  mutation signal appears.)* **Forward constraint:** if a future LLM-proposal channel is built for analyzer ids beyond
  the static registry, it must route through the same `admitSpawn` chokepoint; and
  `ExternalAcquisitionConfig.consent_token` must be stripped/redacted before any persistence of
  `SessionConfig` to a shared artifact. [[deterministic-analyzers-own-vs-acquire]]
  - **⬇ Live-run watch** (audit a **Rust** repo for clippy / a **Ruby** repo for rubocop, with the per-run
    consent token so the gate admits the non-default tool): the tool must actually **spawn and normalize**
    output into leads (cargo-clippy / bundle-rubocop), not skip. FAIL = "skipped" status when the ecosystem
    is present + consent given, or a parse that drops all output. (No Rust/Ruby toolchain on the box →
    install `rustup` / `ruby`+`bundler` first, or point at a repo that vendors them.)

- **Cross-provider quota — live-endpoint confirmation.** Per-provider mappings validated against
  live-shaped fixtures; confirming each source against its **real** endpoint (Claude/Codex live; Copilot/
  Antigravity gated→degrade) is environment-bound. Per-provider recipes:
  [`cross-provider-quota-matrix.md`](../spec/cross-provider-quota-matrix.md). Red line: self-monitoring
  own-provider only, never IDE-GUI automation.
  - **⬇ Live-run watch** (run under each provider whose IDE/CLI you have — Codex CLI is available now):
    the provider's `QuotaSource` must return **live numbers off its real endpoint**, not the fixture/degrade
    fallback — confirm the quota reads are non-empty and move as the run consumes budget. Codex + Claude are
    reachable now; Copilot/Antigravity need those IDEs running. FAIL = a source stuck on degrade when its
    real endpoint is reachable.

- **D-66/67 SLICE-1 — merge-time ownership-gate on the long-lived claims (OD3 layer 2).** Shipped;
  design-of-record + residuals below.
  - **Accepted residual:** the probe window is staleMs-wide, not instantaneous — worst case is a stale
    LAND a beat before an imminent reclaim, never a double-land (base mutations stay serialized by the
    per-node + base-branch locks). Slice-3 heartbeat machinery shrinks it if a real cooperative run
    shows it matters.
  - **Discovered asymmetry:** remediate's `phase:main` mutex has OD3 layer-1 only (`withClaimHeartbeat`
    wraps `advance()`, `nextStep.ts` ~4948), NO layer-2 re-check before persist — unlike audit's
    `auditStep.ts:216-239` template. Not mechanically mirrorable (remediate's persists are distributed
    inside `advance()`); tracked as a still-open correctness gap for slice-3 to fold in.

- **Unify the full rolling-dispatch lifecycle shell across audit + remediate (doc-review D-66/D-67/C-7).
  Slice-1 SHIPPED (entry above); slice-2 VERIFIED not worth building as a shared reducer — Layer A
  (`PartialCompletionTerminal`) is already the correct shared surface; Layer B
  (`advancePausedState`/`LIVELOCK_PAUSE_LIMIT`) is audit-only by nature and correctly forked
  ([[rolling-lifecycle-unify-full-unification-wrong]]); open = slice-3 heartbeat only.**
  Today the genuinely-shared surface is the *admission decision* only
  (`computeDispatchAdmission`, single-sourced in `audit-tools/shared`). Two lifecycle shells around it are
  NOT shared: (a) the pause lifecycle — audit owns `waiting_for_provider`/`pausedState.ts`/`filterNewProviders`;
  remediate has its own separately-implemented `quota_paused` analogue; (b) OD3's heartbeat + merge-time
  ownership-gate revocation protocol — wired only to the short-lived coordination mutexes
  (`withClaimHeartbeat` on bundle-mutation / `phase:main`), NOT the long-lived per-task/per-node execution
  claims (`task-claims.json`, remediate node-claims), which hold a long lease with no live heartbeat and
  rest on dedup-by-id at ingest as the correctness backstop alongside the now-shipped slice-1 merge-time
  gate. The full lifecycle-shell sharing + OD3-heartbeat-on-long-claims is still-intended future work
  (slice-3), not abandoned. Design-of-record specs
  ([`spec/multi-ide-concurrent-runs-design.md`](../spec/multi-ide-concurrent-runs-design.md) OD3;
  [`spec/audit-workflow-design.md`](../spec/audit-workflow-design.md);
  [`spec/remediation-workflow-design.md`](../spec/remediation-workflow-design.md)) now scope the shared
  claim to admission-math and point here for the unification. [[multi-ide-concurrent-runs-design]] /
  [[dispatch-admission-control-design]]
  - **Design-of-record (READ before building slice-3 — it changes the target).**
    The driver + packet engine are ALREADY unified (both orchestrators run `driveRolling` over
    `createRollingDispatcher`); only the pause/resume TERMINAL adapter + OD3-on-long-claims are forked.
    Precise map: audit pause = `RollingEngineLifecycleState` (`src/shared/rolling/pausedState.ts`:
    `running|waiting_for_provider|terminal`; `advancePausedState` reducer; `LIVELOCK_PAUSE_LIMIT=3`; wired in
    `rollingAuditDispatch.ts advanceRollingPause`) — INTERNAL, self-advancing, livelock-bounded, partial-coverage-OK.
    Remediate pause = a `PartialCompletionTerminal{reason:"quota_paused", earliest_reset_at}` variant
    (`src/shared/quota/capacity.ts`; `nextStep.ts` ~4636; stranded nodes stay pending) — EXTERNAL, unbounded,
    host-retries-at-reset. **CRITICAL FINDING: full unification is the WRONG endpoint.** The resume SEMANTICS
    genuinely diverge — audit may bound-and-give-up to partial-coverage synthesis (read-only, safe); remediate must
    NOT abandon half-applied edit-nodes to "partial coverage" (a correctness hazard). So the livelock-terminal-vs-
    wait-forever branch MUST stay a per-orchestrator policy injection; `earliest_reset_at`-driven external resume has
    no audit counterpart. **Shareable core for slice-3 (the actual work, bounded):** a shared
    `withExecutionClaim` = `withClaimHeartbeat` + the merge-time `registry.heartbeat(token)` ownership-gate
    (which today exists ONLY inline on the short bundle-mutation mutex, `auditStep.ts`:219), applied to the
    LONG-lived claims (`task-claims.json` 20-min lease, remediate node-claims 30s) that currently hold a
    lease with NO heartbeat. **Architectural gotcha:** the long claims are held across OUT-OF-PROCESS worker
    runs where the parent isn't looping, so there is no natural beater — adding a heartbeat needs a beating
    owner during the out-of-process span (non-trivial). This is a FOCUSED-LAP track — the most delicate
    machinery in the repo (pause/claim/quota), a genuine divergence to respect, and the owner's own
    "redesign before scheduled autonomy" caution applies; do NOT rush it as a tail-end change.

- **Move the per-lap cadence rules (risk-tier + friction-walk) from host-habit to tool-enforcement
  (doc-review D-68/D-69).** Both halves are tool-enforced: the risk-tier half via the `leanFastPath` →
  Dial A/B continuum fold (the standalone `evaluateFastPath` boolean gate is deleted; finding-level
  simplicity signals fold INTO the risk tier as escalate-on-evidence via `findingRiskEvidence` in
  `src/remediate/riskSignal.ts`, and the lean path is taken IFF the effective tier is `low` — design of
  record [`spec/self-scaling-pipeline-design.md`](../spec/self-scaling-pipeline-design.md),
  [[self-scaling-pipeline-not-forked-paths]]); the friction-walk half via mechanical step-boundary
  capture + an in-run blocking per-category close-out + a session-end Stop-hook backstop.
  - **Genuine residue (accepted, not built):** (a) the LAP-level decision to route an item through the
    orchestrator vs hand-fix it is still host judgment — its tool-enforced end-state is "route substantive work
    through the self-scaling orchestrator" (the [[self-scaling-pipeline-not-forked-paths]] north star), not a new
    gate; (b) a hand-fix lap that never invokes an orchestrator produces no friction artifact, so it is covered
    only by the Stop-hook backstop (and only if a recent run artifact exists in its 12h window). Closing (b)
    mechanically (e.g. block session end on any commit-bearing lap lacking a friction walk) would be fragile and
    over-fire; deferred with `CLAUDE.md`'s "Redesign before scheduled autonomy" rather than force it.
  [[enforce-robustness-in-tooling-not-host-discretion]] / [[self-scaling-pipeline-not-forked-paths]]

- **Context-efficiency access-memory track (items 1-3) shipped; non-blocking follow-up open:** packet `task_ids`/`lens` attribution missing from the token-usage ledger (`DispatchPlanEntry` carries neither).

## Deferred / waiting

- **A2 finding-quality oracle** — the `score-audit` scorer is built; needs operator-authored
  `corpus/<run-id>.labels.json` (hand-labeled real audit runs) before it can score precision/recall.
  - **⬇ To close (after any live audit):** take that run's findings, hand-label each true-positive /
    false-positive into `corpus/<run-id>.labels.json`, then run `score-audit` → precision/recall. The
    labeling is ground-truth human judgment (can't be automated); one solid labeled run unblocks the oracle.
- **A7 multi-host validation** — `npm run verify:hosts` (automated, in `verify:release`) is built and
  green; the provider-matrix e2e is gated behind `RUN_PROVIDER_MATRIX_E2E=1`. **Remaining:** the
  release-time manual GUI checklist ([`host-validation.md`](../spec/host-validation.md)) for GUI-only
  hosts (Antigravity/OpenCode).
- **Manual real-OpenCode validation** that agent-scoped permission allowances propagate to spawned
  subtasks. Folds into the A7 checklist.
- **`/remediate-code` GUI-host manual checklist (parity with `/audit-code`).** `spec/host-validation.md` is
  a manual GUI-host live-dispatch checklist for `/audit-code` only; `/remediate-code` has the automated
  no-drift gate (`verify:remediate-hosts`) but no equivalent manual GUI-host checklist, which the
  "keep orchestrators in parity" convention says it should have. Add a sibling `/remediate-code` checklist
  (or extend `host-validation.md`). Folds into the A7 release-time GUI checklist work.
- **Gated live e2es** skip without creds: `RUN_PROVIDER_MATRIX_E2E=1`, `RUN_NIM_E2E=1`,
  `AUDIT_TOOLS_LIVE_QUOTA=1`, `RUN_AUTONOMY_E2E=1`.
- **Provider `queryLimits`** deferred — revisit if a provider gains a real proactive rate-limit endpoint.
- **Doc-manifest scope for non-`docs/` host assets (doc-review D-45(a), owner call).** `.github/prompts/audit-code.prompt.md`, `.agent/skills/audit-code/SKILL.md`, and ~15 other un-manifested `*.md` outside `docs/` are not covered by `check-doc-manifest.mjs` (it scopes to `docs/**`). Now that a renderer drift guard pins the two audit host assets, the only residual is whether these should be *formally* listed in `doc-review-guidelines.md`'s routing table — a low-value owner judgment call, not code work.
- **Narrow staleness on prose-heavy artifacts via bounded semantic judgment.** Prose-heavy fields feed
  downstream LLM prompts; a cosmetic edit forces wasteful re-emit. The narrowing = bounded judgment on
  meaning change, fail-safe to re-derive. Efficiency-only; defer until re-emit churn is measured.

## Doc-set hygiene (enforced)

- **Canonical doc set is mechanically reconciled.** `scripts/check-doc-manifest.mjs`
  (in `verify:release`) fails the build if any tracked `docs/**/*.md` is absent from the
  routing table in [`doc-review-guidelines.md`](doc-review-guidelines.md), or a row points
  at a deleted file. A stray/dated doc can no longer accumulate silently — it must be
  registered (type + reason) or deleted. The doc-review routine adds the soft layer:
  existence-review every run + version/date/status strings are escalate-not-auto-bump
  (a doc whose only diffs are version bumps is a status doc → propose generate-or-retire).
  Durable design captures go to a canonical design doc or backlog/HANDOFF, **never** a
  dated `*-plan-of-record.md` in the tracked tree (the gate now rejects the latter).

## Durable traps (environment / tooling reference)

Standing gotchas worth keeping for any agent (strong or weak):

- **npm 12.0.0 (local, since ~2026-07-09) blocks dependency install scripts by default (`allowScripts`).**
  Any child `npm install` of a package with a postinstall (e.g. the audit-tools tarball) silently skips the
  script and warns `install scripts blocked because they are not covered by allowScripts`. The allowlist is
  SPEC-keyed per-project (`npm install-scripts approve <pkg>` writes `allowScripts` into the consumer's
  package.json); the global `.npmrc` `allow-scripts=["audit-tools"]` does NOT cover fresh temp-dir installs,
  and `--allow-scripts=<name>` on the CLI doesn't either. Working escape hatches: env
  `npm_config_dangerously_allow_all_scripts=true` (older npm silently ignores it — used by the packaged
  smokes' hermetic installs) or `npm install-scripts approve <pkg>` post-declare. Also new in npm 12:
  `npm pack --json` can emit an OBJECT keyed by tarball name instead of an array (smokes now tolerate both).
  Global `-g` reinstall of audit-tools bins: postinstall may be blocked → run `npm install-scripts approve
  audit-tools` / re-run postinstall manually and verify `~/.claude/commands/*.md` landed
  (extends [[audit-code-global-bin-traps]]).

- **Before starting ANY lap in a worktree, sync with remote main — landed work may be missing.** A worktree
  can be branched from a *stale* local main and miss commits that already landed on `audit-tools/main`. This
  session branched 4 commits behind and **re-implemented a full commit (admission-control 2a) already on
  main**, plus built 2b blind to a pinned design section it lacked — then had to `git reset --hard
  audit-tools/main` + cherry-pick + reconcile. First action of every lap:
  `rtk git fetch audit-tools main && git log --oneline HEAD..audit-tools/main` — if that lists commits,
  rebase/reset onto main BEFORE writing code. (Strengthens [[audit-tools-worktree-traps]].) **Mitigation
  (not a hard gate):** `.claude/skills/start-lap/SKILL.md` operationalizes this sync-first step as an
  agent instruction — it is agent-instruction-driven, so it reduces the risk but does not mechanically
  enforce the fast-forward the way a git gate would.

- **Background long-running command piped through `tail` hides interim progress.** Running a long command
  in the background as `cmd 2>&1 | tail -N` (e.g. `npm run release:patch:publish 2>&1 | tail -40`) makes the
  output file stay EMPTY until the command exits — `tail` buffers and only flushes its last N lines at EOF.
  To watch progress on a background job, do NOT pipe through `tail`; let the harness capture full output (it
  tails the file for you) or redirect to a file and `tail -f` that file separately. Observed 2026-07-08 during
  a release ship — polled an empty file for minutes before realizing the pipe was the cause.

- **`git push audit-tools HEAD:main` prints a "Changes must be made through a pull request" advisory that is
  NOT a rejection.** On a fast-forward push straight to `main` the remote emits that branch-protection
  message, but the ref still updates (`04a7338c..8279d0de  HEAD -> main`, no `! [remote rejected]`). Confirm
  by `git fetch audit-tools main && git rev-parse audit-tools/main` == local HEAD — don't assume the push
  failed on seeing the advisory. Observed 2026-07-08.

- **New remediate test files must import `makeState` from `tests/remediate/test-helpers.ts`, never re-declare it.**
  `INV-remediate-tests-03` (`tests/remediate/remediate-tests-invariants.test.ts`) fails loudly if any test file
  declares a standalone `makeState`. Wrap the shared helper (`makeState({ plan: {...}, items: {...} })`) instead.
  Observed 2026-07-08 (a new `access-memory.test.ts` tripped it).

- **`tests/audit/audit-code-completion.test.mjs` is the heaviest audit integration test.** It drives the
  full multi-phase audit flow in-process (not subprocess-spawned) with an explicit 300s timeout
  (`HEAVY_AUDIT_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS`) for CPU-contended runs. Confirmed: production does not redundantly
  re-extract on an unchanged repo (extractors are presence-gated, not staleness-checked) — the wall is
  legitimate one-time-per-phase extraction, not a caching bug. Remaining lever (test-side only): pre-seed
  artifacts to cut pump iterations.

- **Codex CLI is a poor executor for large read-heavy audit packets under a wall-clock budget.** Observed
  2026-07-04: 2 concurrent codex executors ran 5+ min with zero results and 8k+ lines of echoed reasoning.
  Route only small / low-line packets to the codex pool, or drop it from the audit executor pool for
  read-heavy work. (Durable routing lesson from the admission-control rework.)

- **Remediate-code worktree branches strand commits off main.** Remediate runs on isolated git worktree branches; landed work accumulates on `remediation/<runId>` and the host is left checked out there. By DEFAULT those branches are never auto-merged — the base branch is left untouched for review. Any doc or code fix applied inside a remediate run never reaches main unless explicitly merged. Effect: the doc-review nightly routine (which reviews main) keeps re-surfacing the same findings indefinitely. **Opt-in fix (B5, shipped):** select the `merge-to-base` closing action at the confirm step — the tool then `--no-ff` merges `remediation/<runId>` into your launch branch at close (aborts safely on conflict). Otherwise, after a run that touches docs/code you want on main, merge `remediation/<runId>` manually before the next nightly run.

- **`.gitignore` artifact-tree re-include structure (don't flatten it).** The managed block ignores the
  `.audit-tools/` runtime tree at the CONTENTS level (`.audit-tools/*`, `.audit-tools/*/*`) and re-includes the
  tracked deliverables + `*/agent-feedback.jsonl` — never as a blanket `.audit-tools/` dir-ignore, because git
  cannot re-include a file under an excluded directory. Private ⇒ deliverables tracked; public ⇒ blanket-ignore.
  Single-sourced in `src/shared/io/gitignoreArtifacts.ts` (`renderGitignoreBlock`), idempotent against the
  committed block. If you ever see deliverables un-trackable, it's a stray blanket `.audit-tools/` line OUTSIDE
  the managed markers — delete it, the managed block owns the tree.
- **Tool-managed ignore patterns for runtime artifact dirs MUST be anchored to `.audit-tools/`**, never a
  bare `**/<name>/` — an unanchored glob (e.g. `**/friction/`) regenerates on every `ensure`/postinstall and
  can shadow a same-named SOURCE dir (`src/shared/friction/`), which a file-level edit can't fix. (`.audit-code/`
  is fine — distinct name, no source collision.)
- **The Bash tool is POSIX sh, NOT PowerShell — a PowerShell here-string (`@'…'@`) in a `git commit -m`
  becomes literal `@` characters** top-and-bottom of the message (`@\n<body>\n@`), silently corrupting the
  subject line. Seen twice in one lap (both caught pre-push, amended). For any MULTI-LINE commit/PR body,
  write the message to a temp file and use `git commit -F <file>` (single-line messages via `-m "…"` are
  fine). Applies to every native exe called from the Bash tool, not just git.
- **Wall-clock peak-concurrency tests are latency-fragile.** The rolling-driver integration tests assert
  `peak == N` by dispatching N nodes with a short `setTimeout` and reading the max simultaneous in-flight
  count. Any change that adds per-dispatch latency on the dispatch path (e.g. the reservation-ledger's
  reserve-before-dispatch file-lock) can push admission past the delay window so peak reads `< N` on a slow
  FS (Windows), a green-on-Linux / red-on-Windows or intermittent failure. When you touch the dispatch path,
  expect these and either keep the added latency off the hot path (the finite-budget gate that keeps the
  ledger unwired on the claude-code path) or widen the test's delay well past worst-case admission latency.
  (`tests/remediate/rolling-dispatch-file-ownership-ordering.test.ts` §INV-SOO-03/05.)
- **Fresh git worktree lacks `node_modules`** → `audit-tools/shared` resolves a stale `dist/` (spurious
  "no exported member") → run `npm install` in the worktree first.
- **One test runner: vitest** (all three areas — `tests/audit`, `tests/shared`, `tests/remediate`).
  Run a single file with `npx vitest run <path>`. `node:assert/strict`
  is still permitted as an assertion lib (runs under vitest) for the control-flow assertions
  (`assert.throws`/`rejects`/`doesNotThrow`/`doesNotReject`) that have no clean `expect` equivalent; value
  assertions are `expect`. Vitest `testTimeout` is raised to 120s in `vitest.config.ts`
  because audit integration tests spawn real subprocesses.
- **Don't mask the test exit code.** `npm test > out; echo done` reports the *trailing* command's exit, not the
  suite's — and piping through `grep`/`rm` in the same Bash call races the output file, so a real failure reads
  as "green." Capture the suite's own status: `npm test > out 2>&1 && echo PASS || echo "FAIL=$?"`.
- **Global `-g` install defers `postinstall`** (npm allow-scripts) → the host-integration deploy silently
  skips; finish with `npm i -g --allow-scripts=audit-tools` or `node "$(npm root -g)/audit-tools/scripts/postinstall.mjs"`.
- **A global junction to a LIVE working tree silently shadows a registry install.** If the global
  `audit-tools` is a `Junction` → the working tree (from a prior `npm link`), `npm i -g audit-tools`
  does NOT replace it, and bins run your working-tree dist; invoking a bin *through* the junction path
  can also produce odd artifacts. Fix: `npm rm -g audit-tools` FIRST, then reinstall, and verify
  `(Get-Item <globaldir>).LinkType` is empty before trusting the smoke. (See [[audit-code-global-bin-traps]].)
- **A NEW `.claude/hooks/*.mjs` needs an explicit `!.claude/hooks/<name>` re-include in `.gitignore`.**
  `.gitignore` ignores `.claude/hooks/*` then allowlists each tracked hook by name (deliberate — never ship
  arbitrary `.claude` files). Adding a hook and committing WITHOUT the `!` exception silently drops the file
  from the commit; if `.claude/settings.json` (committed) references it, main now points at an untracked hook
  = broken state. Add the `!.claude/hooks/<name>` line in the same commit as the hook + its settings.json
  registration. (Bit once 2026-07-05: `friction-stop-gate.mjs`.)

- **A `\0` in a Write-tool template literal lands as a RAW NUL byte → binary-flags the source file.** Writing
  `` `${a}\0${b}` `` (a NUL pair-key separator) via the Write tool put a literal 0x00 in the `.ts` source, so git
  treated it as **binary** (`git diff` shows `Bin`/`- -`, grep-hostile) even though tsc/vitest read it fine. Same
  for an in-comment control char. Detect with `python -c "print(open(p,'rb').read().count(0))"`; fix by using a
  text-safe escape that stays a source escape (`U+001F` unit separator) or a printable delimiter. Never embed a
  raw control byte in source — prefer a `\uXXXX` escape the compiler resolves at runtime. (Bit once 2026-07-05:
  `src/shared/decompose/consensus.ts` pairKey.)
- **The Bash tool mangles Windows backslash paths** (`C:\a\b` → `C:ab`) → use forward slashes or the
  PowerShell tool for absolute-path commands.
- **PowerShell**: assign `foreach` output to a var before piping to `ConvertTo-Json`; `-Filter` is not regex
  (use `Where-Object -match`); single-element arrays unwrap in `ConvertTo-Json` (bracket-wrap the payload).
- **Packaged/global-install drift is caught ONLY by `smoke:packaged-*` (`verify:release`), never by dev or
  vitest — so it fails the release gate loudly, not silently.** Two ways to break the tarball that pass every
  local check: (1) a production runtime `import` declared as a `devDependency` — devDeps are present in dev +
  the vitest suite, so only the packaged smoke hits `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (when you add an `import` to any
  `src/` module that lands in `dist/` on a production path, confirm the package is under `dependencies`; bit
  once 2026-07-04 by `zod-to-json-schema` in `src/audit/contracts/workerSchemas.ts`); (2) deleting a *shipped*
  file that the smoke's `requiredPackagedPaths` list asserts (`scripts/audit/smoke-packaged-audit-code.mjs`,
  `verify-hosts.mjs`) → the gate fails on the missing tarball path. Diagnostic, not a silent trap: if
  `smoke:packaged` errors on a missing/absent module or path, this is why.
- **Async typecheck hook = stale-dist false alarm** after a shared-source edit (it runs `tsc` before the
  central rebuild); the authoritative gate is `npm run check` after `npm run build`.
- **Prefer a dependency-injection seam over module mocking** in tests. Under vitest, `vi.spyOn`/`vi.mock`
  and fake timers (`vi.useFakeTimers({ toFake: [...] })`) are available, but the codebase's established
  pattern is injectable deps (`WorkerRunDeps`, `createWriteStream`/`spawn` seams) — keep using those.
- **Front-load a broad "does this already exist" sweep BEFORE authoring goal_spec/context_bundle/
  module_decomposition, not just a targeted one.** A narrow Explore before contract authoring is the top
  repair-round-churn driver — search the WHOLE repo for equivalent logic AND independently re-verify the
  target symbol's own type/shape against source at least once per contract. The cost of one broader Explore
  call or one grep is far lower than a full adversarial repair round or an implement-time revert.
  [[front-load-broad-search-before-contract-authoring]]
- **Don't fan out a large mechanical edit across parallel subagents that spawn their OWN grandchildren.**
  For a broad mechanical sweep over a shared file set, run it as ONE serial agent (or partition by
  NON-overlapping files), never an uncoordinated fan-out; and never hand-edit the same files while a
  background agent is live on them.
- **`rtk` compresses files you need verbatim.** When reading the `audit-code` skill body or `docs/backlog.md`
  through `rtk read`, content gets partially summarized with retrieval hashes → not exact. For any file you must
  act on verbatim, use raw `Get-Content -Raw` (or the Read tool), not `rtk read`.
- **`rtk proxy` runs executables, not PowerShell cmdlets.** `rtk proxy Get-Content` / `rtk proxy Get-ChildItem`
  fail (cmdlets aren't standalone exes). Working form: `rtk proxy powershell -NoProfile -Command "..."`.
- **`rtk proxy rg` fails with `Access is denied`** (Codex/win32). Fallback: PowerShell `Select-String` (or the
  Grep tool).
- **Never pass `isolation: "worktree"` to the Agent tool when dispatching a remediate-code/audit-code implement
  node.** The tool's own dispatch plan already creates and names the node's worktree; adding the Agent tool's
  OWN `isolation: "worktree"` spawns a second, unrelated git worktree and the subagent edits source files there
  instead of the tool-designated one — `accept-node`'s cherry-pick then sees no diff.
  [[no-agent-isolation-worktree-for-dispatch-nodes]]
- **No host-side unblock for a wedged audit run — use `audit-code force-synthesis`.** Host-side attempts to
  unblock a stuck audit (pending tasks that won't clear) do NOT work and actively corrupt gitignored
  run-state: marking `status:complete` in `audit_tasks.json` is ignored; writing
  `partial_completion_terminal.stranded_ids` is overwritten; appending results with unique idempotency keys
  clears the obligation but cascades stale `planning_artifacts`. The only clean recovery is the tool-owned
  affordance — `audit-code force-synthesis` stamps an `operator_forced` partial-completion terminal over the
  pending task ids (durable direct write to `active-dispatch.json`, the special-loaded artifact
  `writeCoreArtifacts` doesn't own) and drives the synthesis executor from the intact ledger on partial
  coverage, with no hand-editing of gitignored run-state. (`src/audit/cli/forceSynthesisCommand.ts`;
  `buildOperatorForcedTerminal` in shared; e2e in `tests/audit/audit-code-completion.test.mjs`.)
