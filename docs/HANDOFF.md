# HANDOFF — audit-tools

> Immediate state and next action only. Durable design lives in `CLAUDE.md` and `spec/`;
> open work lives in `docs/backlog/`.

## Live state

- **v0.50.15 is live. HEAD is `93d0a8ee` on `main`** — the offload-lane and attest-preflight lap.
  Two fixes landed, and three defects were logged rather than worked. The offload workspace-trust
  leg is DELETED in both homes — this repo's `session-start-guards.mjs` and the machine registry
  `~/.agent-config/offload-lane-data.mjs` — because its stated consequence never followed from its
  condition: measured four ways, a lane in an UNTRUSTED workspace reads a gitignored file and
  returns its content, with the tool flag, without it, and from a directory in no `projects` map
  (`a239dc68`, owner decision). The attest preflight now refuses only when the worktree tree equals
  the staged tree BEFORE and AFTER its legs run, and otherwise abstains — recording unattributed
  passes as well as failures, because the false-green half was silent (`93d0a8ee`). Logged, not
  worked: the closeout Stop gate demands a hand-back at a lap START (`ad4a9cd9`); a dispatched lane
  runs this repo's sprint ceremony unless its caller sets `AUDIT_TOOLS_CHILD_SESSION=1`
  (`f9e9cc3d`); `check:memory-citations` is inert in every lap worktree and ticks the skip
  (`18c71faf`).

## Immediate next

**Nothing is pinned.** The queue is the backlog ([`backlog.md`](backlog.md)); the standing
program direction remains *redesign before scheduled autonomy* → the autonomous
audit→remediate→PR capstone once the architecture items are worked off.


## Deliberate state, not bugs

- `tests/audit/host-delegation-fold-carries-advisories.test.ts` remains deliberately unbaselined:
  its parallel-load timeout passes alone and is tracked as a known flake, so rebaselining it would
  hide a real regression.
- The detached host runner is intentionally not running.
- The tracked decision-queue snapshot STILL disagrees with the ledger that settles it, and it will
  keep doing so: its writer refuses a batch that drops a record-path item on its own, so no lap can
  quietly true it up. What changed is the consumer, not the artifact — `start-lap` step 5 now asks
  the decision ledger (`answer.mjs --list`) and treats it as the authority (`0ada039a`), because
  trusting the snapshot cost a lap four questions the ledger had already recorded settled AND landed.
  **Ask the ledger. Never read the snapshot for what is open.** The artifact's own freshness gate
  remains the real fix and is stated in full in its [`open-bugs.md`](backlog/open-bugs.md) entry,
  which is its home.
- The item-6 checkJs sweep remains type-only by contract; behavioral changes are bugs, not part of
  that refactor.
- The added-root-entry teardown false red is LEFT OPEN on purpose. Two adversarial rounds killed
  both candidate mechanisms by measurement — writer attribution is unavailable in ESM, and no
  exclusivity predicate exists — so nothing was changed rather than shipping a false green. The
  entry in [`open-bugs.md`](backlog/open-bugs.md) carries the dead designs and the three constraints
  a third attempt must satisfy, so the next try starts ahead rather than repeating these two.
- The attest preflight now ABSTAINS whenever the worktree and staged trees differ. That is a
  deliberate coverage reduction, not an oversight: it trades unreliable refusals for a recorded
  abstention, and its three uncovered halves are stated in the backlog entry and as `uncovered` data
  in the guard-reach registry.
