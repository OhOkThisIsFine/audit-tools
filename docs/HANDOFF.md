# HANDOFF — audit-tools

> **Audience:** the next agent instantiation (no memory of the session that produced this).
> **The single rolling handoff** — keep using *this* file; trim it as state changes, don't spawn
> per-topic handoffs. **Immediate next steps only** — durable concepts live in `CLAUDE.md`, the
> program of record in `docs/backlog.md`, history in git/memory. Do NOT turn this back into a changelog.

## Where things stand

- **A12 — single-package collapse: ✓ DONE + MERGED (2026-06-18, `main` `27c7a24e`).** The repo is now
  **ONE package `audit-tools`** (not a monorepo). `@audit-tools/shared` + `auditor-lambda` +
  `remediator-lambda` collapsed into one root package exposing both bins (`audit-code`, `remediate-code`),
  shared inlined. Green end-to-end: build + check clean; shared **724** / audit **2129** / remediate **1607**;
  all 4 smokes; `verify:release` exits 0 locally **and on Linux CI (dry-run green)**. Layout + import +
  publish facts: memory `a12-single-package-collapse-done`; plan/history `docs/a12-single-package-collapse-plan.md`.
  - **New reality (internalize before touching anything):** `src/{shared,audit,remediate}` →
    `dist/{shared,audit,remediate}`; imports use `audit-tools/shared` (exports self-reference + tsconfig
    `paths`), NEVER `@audit-tools/shared`. One `tsconfig.json`, one `npm run build`. Asset dirs at repo root.
    Tests: node:test `.mjs` (tests/shared, tests/audit) + vitest (tests/remediate). Plain `vX.Y.Z` release tags.
    One `ci.yml`/`publish-package.yml` job. `opencode.json` at root has both agent scopes.

- **A6 completeness follow-up: ✓ landed on `main` `07f387d` (UNPUBLISHED, 2026-06-19).** The merged A6
  deleted all JSON schemas but left 6 contracts as plain TS interfaces; converted them to zod single-source
  (`RemediationOutcome{,Status,sReport}`, `IntentCheckpoint`, `AuditState`, `AuditScopeManifest`,
  `FlowCoverageManifest`, `AnalyzerCapabilityRecord`) + prereq schemas + `OUTCOME_KEYS` derived. Behavior-
  identical (z.infer), so a republish is OPTIONAL — rolls into the next `release:patch` whenever one ships.
  Details: memory `a6-zod-single-source-done`.
- **PUBLISH: ✓ `audit-tools@0.28.2` LIVE on npm** (`latest`, OIDC CI run `27801269989`, tokenless). Carries
  the dogfood's 3 rolling-dispatch fixes + F5–F8 (below). Global bins reinstalled + postinstall run; both
  `--version` → 0.28.2. (0.28.1 = prior win32 audit fix + NIM e2e.) Go-forward release path:
  `env -u CLAUDECODE npm run release:patch:publish`.
- **Old-name deprecations: ✓ DONE (Ethan, via npm website, 2026-06-19).** `auditor-lambda` /
  `remediator-lambda` / `@audit-tools/shared` are deprecated → redirect to `audit-tools`. No npm actions
  outstanding.

- **DOGFOOD remediate-code on its own backlog: ✓ DONE (2026-06-18).** Full record:
  `docs/dogfood-remediation-findings-2026-06-18.md`. Drove `remediate-code` end-to-end (full contract pipeline +
  adversarial critic→judge→repair + rolling implement). **Found+fixed 3 bugs (the rolling implement path was
  100% broken on Windows):** win32 verify-shim (`6a551b28`), stale-branch reset (`c9575b7f`), orphaned-dir reset
  (`e29cec16`). **Landed F5–F8 THROUGH the tool** (accept-node verify+merge → cherry-picks `bca2850c`/`3ecb492d`/
  `c5005289`): parseJsonLoose balance-scan + response_format default-on/degrade; OBL-CO-01 explicit
  POSITIVE:/NEGATIVE: labels; INV-CO-12 seam_adjustments corpus; validate-artifact envelope unwrap. Discovered 6
  backlog items already-shipped (pruned). Durable lesson: memory `rolling-implement-windows-and-writescope-findings`.

## Immediate next

**2026-06-19 dogfood work: ✓ SHIPPED.** `resume-list-dogfood-fixes` merged to `main`;
**`audit-tools@0.28.3` LIVE** (8 code-bug fixes + notes 1–3: lens proposition table
`0092405b`/`e88d1afa`; standardized per-finding block `0092405b`; up-front ambiguity gate `264b36da`
+ mid-run `needs_clarification` outcome `70d74a8d`). Follow-up `013438ab` (Ethan: auditor↔remediator
parity) single-sources the finding-display block into `src/shared/reporting/findingDisplay.ts` —
ships as **0.28.4**. Branch `resume-list-dogfood-fixes` can be deleted.

**Remaining go-forward program** (`docs/backlog.md` → "Accepted go-forward program"): A7 (host
install/integration validation across Codex/OpenCode/Antigravity), A8 hybrid spill topology + live
cross-provider run, deferred A2/A9/A10.

**Open dogfood frictions (write-scope / input-resume): ✓ CLEARED earlier (2026-06-19, on this branch).**
- ✓ Write-scope now ENFORCED before the cherry-pick (the architecturally-significant one). Moved into
  `acceptNodeWorktree` → `enforceAcceptWriteScope`: after verify, before merge, so an out-of-scope edit never
  lands; a blocked node is `merged:false` → triage with the reason in its diagnostic. The worker's
  `amended_files` are adjudicated at accept time against an ephemeral `OwnershipRegistry` seeded from every
  block's declared scope (unowned → granted/widened = the surfaced amend path; sibling-owned → seam conflict).
  The redundant post-hoc merge-time gate was deleted; declared scope is single-sourced from the persisted
  dispatch plan. New gate tests in `host-rolling-dispatch.test.ts`.
- ✓ `--input` re-passed after intake now RESUMES (no `input_conflict`) when it matches the run's recorded intake
  source (`suppliedInputMatchesRun` in `nextStep.ts`); a different input still trips the gate. Backend fix, not
  loader guidance. Test in `next-step-lifecycle.test.ts`.
- ✓ (prior PR #9) `accept-outcome` sidecar persists the failing command + output; rolling-dispatch prompt shows
  `accept-node --id <BLOCK_ID> --run-id <runId>`.

**Remaining accepted program** (`docs/backlog.md` → "Accepted go-forward program"):
- **A7 (REFRAMED)** — validate the host install/integration machinery across all hosts (Codex, OpenCode,
  Antigravity), not just Claude Code.
- Deferred: **A2** (falsifiable finding-quality oracle), **A9/A10** (autonomy acceptance + multi-process).
- **A8 loose end:** the {host-subagent + NIM} HYBRID spill topology (FINDING-020 capstone) + a live
  cross-provider spill run. See `docs/a8-rolling-cutover-plan.md`. (audit-code NIM e2e already DONE in 0.28.1.)

## Working constraints (single-package)
- **Green at every commit:** `npm run build && npm run check` → zero errors. Commit hook enforces it.
- **CLAUDECODE** is set in-session; UNSET it for true-green test/gate runs (`env -u CLAUDECODE …`).
- **Tests:** `npm test` (build + node:test shared+audit + vitest remediate). vitest runs source-mode (no
  build) — `npx vitest run` from repo root (config restricts to `tests/remediate`).
- **verify:release** = check + test + 4 smokes (`scripts/{audit,remediate}/smoke-*`). The smokes pack ONE
  `audit-tools` tarball; Windows-flaky on temp-dir EPERM/EBUSY — re-run a smoke before calling it a regression.
- **Release/publish:** `scripts/release-and-publish.mjs <bump>` bumps + tags `vX.Y.Z` + GitHub Release →
  OIDC CI publishes. For a first/manual publish, `gh release create vX.Y.Z --target main`. Recover a bad
  attempt with `gh release delete vX.Y.Z --cleanup-tag` (or re-run the run after fixing the prereq).
- **Ship** via the `/ship` skill once the trusted-publisher prereq is in place and a milestone lands.
