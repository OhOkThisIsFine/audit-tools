# HANDOFF — audit-tools

> Immediate state and next action only. Durable design lives in `CLAUDE.md` and `spec/`;
> open work lives in `docs/backlog/`.

## Live state

- **v0.51.0 is live**, published from the release commit `e6329a44`; the release workflow
  passed and the registry artifact is installed globally. Both `audit-code --version` and
  `remediate-code --version` report `0.51.0`.
- **Every owner-answered decision that is actionable here has a landed commit** recorded in
  the decisions ledger under `.claude/`, except one: routing the leg-2 triage sweep through
  `llm-relay dispatch` so the relay owns lane choice. The owner lifted its wait on the llm-relay
  repository on 2026-09-04 (llm-relay is faster now); it is this repository's next lap.
- **The four closeout decisions of 2026-09-04 are answered**: the one cleanup rule stays as
  landed; a `custom` closing action keeps its command on the checkpoint with no close-phase
  preview; the Node matrix stays on floating majors; test-command detection is a filed
  forward track, not wired.
- **The nine live-run design assumptions are decided**: the owner confirmed eight and reversed
  one on 2026-09-04, as the design-gate record states beside each in
  [`live-run-defect-set-design-gate-2026-09-03.md`](reviews/live-run-defect-set-design-gate-2026-09-03.md).

## Immediate next

Route the leg-2 triage sweep (`scripts/shared/triage-backlog.mjs`) through `llm-relay dispatch`
instead of naming a model through the router (ledger item 133f4f815b608ea4, owner answer
2026-09-03, wait lifted 2026-09-04). The external 5-primary + 5-held-out paired benchmark run
described in [`forward-tracks.md`](backlog/forward-tracks.md) stays the pinned forward track.

## Deliberate state, not bugs

- The judge-side naming refusal is unreachable on the production path by design of the parse
  order: the property it guards holds twice over, and only its claimed reach does not. Tracked
  in [`minor-bugs.md`](backlog/minor-bugs.md).
- The charter packet builder no longer caps packet size; its coverage manifest records only
  unreadable or empty omissions.

> **Every open item lives in [`docs/backlog/`](backlog/)**, reachable by the seek index in
> [`backlog.md`](backlog.md) — this block is not a second index of it.
> Every line is a POINTER: the backlog entry's own title, verbatim, and a link to the file that
> holds its spec. Nothing here restates a spec, so this list and the backlog cannot drift.
> Regenerate: `node scripts/shared/generate-handoff-roadmap.mjs` (`--check` gates it in
> `verify:checks` and at commit). 1 pinned item(s).

### ▶ Next up — pinned in the backlog

- ▶ Audit-tools deep-review acceptance benchmark still needs its external run. · [`forward-tracks.md`](backlog/forward-tracks.md)
