# Minor open bugs (low severity)

> The LOW-severity tail of [`open-bugs.md`](open-bugs.md), split out 2026-08-28 when that file
> reached its 120,000-byte ceiling and every new entry had to be paid for by condensing another.
>
> Same rules, same lifecycle, same sweeps — this is a size split, not a lower standard. An entry
> here is still a fixable defect that is fixed in tooling and DELETED once it ships. Severity is
> the only thing that decides which file an entry lives in, so re-tagging one moves it.
>
> Part of the split backlog — index: [`docs/backlog.md`](../backlog.md).
> A living to-do list, not a status log. Remove an entry once it ships; record durable
> contracts and rationale in project memory or `CLAUDE.md`, never "where the code is today".

- **DD-9 + charter slice-staleness — residual only, revisit on live evidence (2026-07-23, low,
  accepted).** The pair SHIPPED; its mechanism record is the single home —
  [`intent-gate-charter-slice-design-2026-07-23.md`](../reviews/intent-gate-charter-slice-design-2026-07-23.md).
  Accepted residuals (`charter_clarification` is sliced since 2026-10-04, and `systemic_challenge`'s
  whole-manifest edge is exact, not a residual — `dependencySlices.ts` states both):
  (b) under-stale, and NARROWER than the first draft of this entry
  claimed: `charterReadFileSlice` compares content for consensus members ∪ every `isDocIntentFile`
  path (`doc_only` status **OR** `.md/.markdown/.adoc/.rst/.txt` — single-sourced at
  `buildStructureDecomposition.ts` so it can never be narrower than the decomposition's own doc
  universe; pinned by `tests/audit/dependency-slices.test.ts`), PLUS the complete sorted path list,
  so every add / delete / rename fires regardless of classification. What stays outside is a
  content-only edit to a file that is neither a consensus member nor doc-extensioned nor `doc_only`
  — e.g. spec prose living inside a `.ts` the Stated pass reads. Widen `charterReadFileSlice` if a
  live run shows it. (c) over-cost: a revert pair (intent A→B judged, then B→A) re-pays one judge
  round — verdicts are materialized into the baseline (`intentEquivalenceExecutor.ts`), never cached
  per-pair.
